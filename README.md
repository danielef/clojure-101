# clojure-101

A Clojure project for helping to teach the basics of Clojure. Defines two namespaces:

* src/clojure_101/core.clj
  * Walks through the very basics of Clojure.
* src/clojure_101/turtle.clj
  * A playground for trying out Clojure syntax and basics by calling functions that tell a "turtle" where to walk and draw things. Uses the [clojure-turtle](https://github.com/google/clojure-turtle) library.
